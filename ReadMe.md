# About

Individual project to practice working with an external API. Additionally, this was an opportunity to work with React Router (3). The project is fairly simple, pulling in Chuck Norris jokes upon request from an external API - http://www.icndb.com/api/. Comps were provided for the UI. A toggle radio button extension was implemented to begin exploring new UI functionalities. 

##### Additional features include:
* Parental Controls
* Name change controls
